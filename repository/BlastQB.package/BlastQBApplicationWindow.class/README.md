BlastQBApplicationWindow open.

A Blast Query Builder application object presents a user-interface to add, edit, load and execute queries against a Blast result set in XML.

Each query is composed of a property, a comparison operator and a query value.

When the user selects a BLAST property, the appropiate comparison operators are automatically filtered and selected in the comparators list. For example, selecting 'Alignment Length' property will select only numeric comparison operators.
